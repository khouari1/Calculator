Calculator
==========

Trying to make a calculator using different formats.

Just started using Python and I am using a Calculator program to try out a few things I've learnt.

Created with Python 2.7.6

To do:
==========

1. Shorten the script using functions where possible
2. Create a function asking the user if they want to run the program again
